(2013) Complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of the threadfin cichlid (Petrochromis trewavasae) and the blunthead cichlid (Tropheus moorii) and patterns of mitochondrial genome evolution in cichlid fishes. \r\n[Fischer et al 2013.pdf](https://github.com/mjmillerlab/mitoselection/files/83730/Fischer.et.al.2013.pdf)<br>\r\n\r\nPLoS One 8: e67048.10.1371/journal.pone.0067048 The cichlid fishes of the East African Great Lakes represent a model especially suited to study adaptive radiation and speciation. With several African cichlid genome projects being in progress, a promising set of closely related genomes is emerging, which is expected to serve as a valuable data base to solve questions on genotype-phenotype relations. The mitochondrial (mt) genomes presented here are the first results of the assembly and annotation process for two closely related but eco-morphologically highly distinct Lake Tanganyika cichlids, Petrochromis trewavasae and Tropheus moorii. The genomic sequences comprise 16,588 bp (P. trewavasae) and 16,590 bp (T. moorii), and exhibit the typical mitochondrial structure, with 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a non-coding control region. Analyses confirmed that the two species are very closely related with an overall sequence similarity of 96%. We analyzed the newly generated sequences in the phylogenetic context of 21 published labroid fish mitochondrial genomes. Consistent with other vertebrates, the D-loop region was found to evolve faster than protein-coding genes, which in turn are followed by the rRNAs; the tRNAs vary greatly in the rate of sequence evolution, but on average evolve the slowest. Within the group of coding genes, ND6 evolves most rapidly. Codon usage is similar among examined cichlid tribes and labroid families; although a slight shift in usage patterns down the gene tree could be observed. Despite having a clearly different nucleotide composition, ND6 showed a similar codon usage. C-terminal ends of Cox1 exhibit variations, where the varying number of amino acids is related to the structure of the obtained phylogenetic tree. This variation may be of functional relevance for Cox1 synthesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Hofman CA et al.

This study examines the influence of phylogenetic patterns of metabolic activity on the evolution of mitochondrial DNA in fishes, given energy requirements associated with high performance versus sedentary life histories. It was determined that all 13 protein coding genes of the mitogenome experience a relaxation of purifying selection in sedentary fishes. This phenomenon was not detected in nuclear housekeeping genes, suggesting that it can be explained by the energy requirements of these groups, and possibly their effective population sizes. This study also examined the subunit binding sites of two subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (COXI and COXIII), and did not detect any differences in selection between these groups of fishes. These cytochrome c oxidase subunits interact with subunits that are encoded by the nuclear genome and it has been suggested that a unique form of coevolution occurs between these genomes in order to maintain function, and may have implications for speciation. Although this was not a main focus of this study, our preliminary results suggest that substitutions in subunit binding site regions are rare. The results from this study add to the growing literature on the complex relationship between mitochondrial DNA and the evolution of life histories across the tree of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Tomasco IH, Lessa EP (2014) Two mitochondrial genes under episodic positive selection in subterranean octodontoid rodents. Gene 534: 371-8.10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.097\r\n[Tomasco & Lessa 2014.pdf](https://github.com/mjmillerlab/mitoselection/files/83734/Tomasco.Lessa.2014.pdf)\r\n<br>\r\n Tuco-tucos (Ctenomys) and related coruros (Spalacopus) are South American subterranean rodents. An energetically demanding lifestyle within the hypoxic, underground atmosphere may change the selective regime on oxidative phosphorylation. We examined whether weak and/or episodic positive directional selection affected the evolution of two mitochondrial genes (COX2, CytB), in a background of purifying selection in these lineages. We estimated rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitutions and found: 1) significantly higher dN/dS ratio in subterranean groups relative to non-subterranean related species, and 2) two codons in each gene under episodic selection: 94 and 277 of COX2 and 269 and 307 of CytB.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Jacobsen MW et al.

Mol Phylogenet Evol 95: 161-70.10.1016/j.ympev.2015.11.008 \r\n[Jacobsen et al 2016.pdf](https://github.com/mjmillerlab/mitoselection/files/83732/Jacobsen.et.al.2016.pdf)\r\n\r\nSeveral studies have recently reported evidence for positive selection acting on the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome), emphasizing its potential role in adaptive divergence and speciation. In this study we searched 107 full mitogenomes of recently diverged species and lineages of whitefish (Coregonus ssp.) for signals of positive selection. These salmonids show several distinct morphological and ecological differences that may be associated with energetics and therefore potentially positive selection at the mitogenome level. We found that purifying selection and genetic drift were the predominant evolutionary forces acting on the analyzed mitogenomes. However, the NADH dehydrogenase 2 gene (ND2) showed a highly elevated dN/dS ratio compared to the other mitochondrial genes, which was significantly higher in whitefish compared to other salmonids. We therefore further examined nonsynonymous evolution in ND2 by (i) mapping amino acid changes to a protein model structure which showed that they were located away from key functional residues of the protein, (ii) locating them in the sequences of other species of fish (Salmonidae, Anguillidae, Scombridae and Percidae) only to find pronounced overlap of nonsynonymous regions. We thus conclude that relaxed purifying selection is driving the evolution of ND2 by affecting mostly regions that have lower functional relevance.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
